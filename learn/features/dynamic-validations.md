# Dynamic Validations

Saral App supports dynamic validation feature. As this application will be used by different educational boards , this feature will avoid maintaining different frontend source code to customise validations. This feature is available from `v1.5.1` release.

The validations can be configured in the ROI Layouts JSON in backend using regular expressions and failure messages.&#x20;

Refer [layout-specification.md](../specifications/layout-specification.md "mention") and [layout-configuration.md](../../use/layout-configuration.md "mention")for details about ROI Layout configuration.
