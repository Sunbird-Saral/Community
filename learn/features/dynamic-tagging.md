# Dynamic Tagging

Saral App supports dynamic tagging feature. This feature is able to tag each question with category of questions as applicable.

This feature can be enabled when `/schools/login` response has `tags` field set to true.

```
{
   "school":{
      "storeTrainingData":true,
      "name":"Dummy School 1",
      "schoolId":"u002",
      "state":"up",
      "autoSync":false,
      "autoSyncFrequency":900000,
      "tags":true
   }
}
```
