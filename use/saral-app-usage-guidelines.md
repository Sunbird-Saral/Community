# Saral App Usage Guidelines

1. Make sure scanning with Mobile/Tab happens in Landscape mode(shown in **Figure#1** below). ![](../.gitbook/assets/landscape\_mode1.jpeg)(**Figure#1**)

2\. Printed layouts have 4 dark circles on the corner of the sheets(shown in **Figure#2**). Make sure these are printed with a proper quality printer. Avoid xerox copies of these layouts.

3\. Make sure the user is holding the device is in a stable state until the predictions appear on the App screen.

4\. For OMR sheets make sure bubbles are filled using a blue or black ball pen without any gaps for proper detection.

5\. Succesful scan from Saral App will have indications shown in below Figures.

(**Figure#4**) Processing detected layout for predictions. Make sure the "Please wait, scanning is in progress !!" message in blue colour is in the same direction as the layout. If both of them are  oriented in a different direction then its the wrong way to scan.
